# ML-for-High-z-Classification
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying galaxy redshifts as high ( z >= 4) or low (z &lt; 4). This repository contains the complete model architecture built in PyTorch, with clear, modular code designed for easy customisation and extension.
